**-- Renaming variables to match waves--**
* I realize that for the Module Politics and Values the suffix 15 was missing. There was a one-year gap between waves 7 and wave 8. Therefore, wave 8 was only measured in 2016. Whereas for the other two modules merged here wave 8 corresponds to 2015. I considered the option of renaming the Politics and Values variables to match the years.
